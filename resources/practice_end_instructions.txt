That's the end of the practice. 

The next block of trials is the start of the real experiment. 

The task is the same, but as you progress from block to block some characteristics of the decks will change.

REMEMBER: Your choice is between both the points and the stimuli associated with each card (one of the choices will always be spider-free). 

And don't forget to move your mouse upwards to make the decks appear!
