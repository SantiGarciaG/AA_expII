						  **INSTRUCTIONS**
        
The following task consists of a card game where on each trial you can choose one of two cards displayed at the upper corners of the screen (by clicking on it with the mouse). 

Each card will provide you with different amounts of points and it will be followed by an image. You'll have to look at the image for a specified period before you can continue.
 
Each trial starts when you press the "start" button, located at the lower centre of the screen. You have to move your mouse upwards to make the cards appear and please choose one of them as soon as you can.

Each trial-block will terminate upon completing a specified number of points. 

Your goal is to gain as many points as possible in the least amount of trials, but you might want to consider also the stimuli associated with each deck: 
At one point during the task, one card will be associated with neurtal images whereas the other one will be associated with images of spiders. You can choose any card at any time, and there will always be a spider-free choice (i.e., if you don't want to see the spiders you can always select the alternative card instead).
